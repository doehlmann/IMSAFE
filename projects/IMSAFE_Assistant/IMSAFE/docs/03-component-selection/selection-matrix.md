# IMSAFE – Component Selection Matrix

Purpose:
- Compare candidate components objectively
- Support evidence-based selection
- Capture trade-offs clearly

Each matrix should focus on ONE feature or subsystem.

---

## Subsystem
(e.g. Barometric Pressure Sensor)

## Functional Requirements
(Summarise from functional spec)
- Measurement range:
- Accuracy:
- Interface:
- Supply voltage:
- Environment:
- Other constraints:

| Typical Current | | | | |
| Interface (I2C/SPI/etc) | | | | |
| Accuracy / Resolution | | | | |
| Noise / Stability | | | | |
| Temp Range | | | | |
| Package / Footprint | | | | |
| Assembly Risk | | | | |
| Firmware Complexity | | | | |
| Availability / Lifecycle | | | | |
| Cost (relative) | | | | |

## Weighted Score (optional)
(Only use if helpful)

| Candidate | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|
| A | | |
| B | | |
| C | | |

---

## Preliminary Recommendation
(Which candidate appears strongest and why)

---

## Risks / Unknowns
(What still needs validation or testing)
